# 13-Week-Roadmap
Execution of 13 week road map 3 sessions per day. Each session is 3h long. 
I will divide each session into three parts with 50 minutes of constantly deep work and then a break of 10 minutes.
Once the seassion is ended there would be a break of 30-40 minutes and in that 30-40 minutes.
I will end each session by summarizing what i did.

Pro tip: Set clear micro-goals per session before starting
